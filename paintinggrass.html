        <p> Painting Grass is a video with random generative and interactive effects that could be played for a length of time as a part of a larger installation appreciating movement. Users can start and stop the video as well as change between either a warm or cool state. The opacities of the colored filters in each state are audio reactive and their shades are randomly generated within a controlled range of values. The process started with capturing a video of prairie grasses blowing in the wind. I then used Premiere and Photoshop to extract 12 fps for 4 seconds of video and cropped them to a printable scale. Once the 48 frames were printed, I painted colored lines on top of them and scanned them back into the computer at 600dpi before reassembling them into a stop-motion animated video. I then coded a generative patch in resolume wire with start and stop triggers that randomly changes the speed of the video over time and rewinds the video after about 3 minutes. The wire patch detects the objects in the video and adds colored filters to them. I then mounted the wire patch into resolume avenue so that users can interact with it. I pulled audio from the original video capture and modulated it in metasounds. I added random stereo delay and a high pass filter to the wav. I then crossfaded it with another version of the wav that had a random pitch shift, and passed it through a state variable filter, and a random flanger. The crossfade value was randomized. Finally, I mixed this with a random sine wave which was multiplied with noise and passed through a dynamic filter with random oscillations. I exported 2 minutes of the sound and imported it to resolume avenue. In the wire patch I added two float-in nodes that control the opacities of the colored filters. I then changed the settings for these opacities in avenue so that they would be reactive to the audio.</p>
