        <div class="type">
<p>Sculpture created from found, natural objects. Objects are mounted and fused with hot glue and yarn is crocheted over the branches to exaggerate stereotypical depictions and add softness to the piece. A variety of organic textures are present such as pointed pine needles, a spiral pinecone, and smooth rocks which create visual interest when combined. A piece of a tree trunk is used as the middle base of the composition and the areas around it are filled in with strips of bark and large rocks. The lighter objects such as leaves and small rocks were placed on top of the bark and larger rocks to add dimension. The branches in the back and on the sides are standing up to balance the piece and extend the sculpture upward.</p>
