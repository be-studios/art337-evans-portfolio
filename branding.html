        <h1> Logo for Organization of Latino/a/x Employees </h1>
        </div>
        
        <div class="type">
        <p>This logo supports the mission of OLE which is to provide a sense of community for latinx employees and to advocate for increased diversity within the university. The logo uses vibrant, warm colors to emphasize the character and individuality of each being as well as to spark a comforting, homey feeling. The letterforms are touching to symbolize the connectivity of the latinx community and the L and E are slightly leaning to illustrate that the latinx community leans on and advocates for each other. The logo has a humanistic, handwritten feel with dark outlines to simulate the graphic look of popart and murals. This is due to the fact that use of the hand and craftsmanship is essential to the history of latinx individuals across the globe. The letterforms have been embroidered to further showcase this rich artisanship as well as to emphasize a thread of connectivity weaving latinx individuals from many backgrounds together. The flower peeking through the O is inspired from patterning commonly found in Gautemalan embroidery and it stands for resiliency and growth. This logo is meant to feel personal and hand crafted so that it simulates leaving a signature or mark on the page. This symbolizes the advocacy for change that defines OLE. The accompanying typeface is Newbery Sans Pro Expanded. It was created by latinx artist Alejandro Paul, and is named after Buenos Aires's local airport. It contains many weights and includes tildes and accents for use with latin languages.</p>
