          <p><em> Transforming a familiar space into an unfamiliar one in an XR environment.</em></p>
          <p>Objects in a familiar environment transform as users interact with them. Users are placed in an XR environment with passthrough enabled. The passthrough has edge rendering in a bright color as well as colorization on the passthrough layer. Users will feel uneasy as they are placed in a recognizable, yet distorted environment. Unity assets are used for the virtual interactable models that render on load and they are affected by a colored, directional light. As users hover over the virtual objects, slightly distorted versions of the objects take their place. These distorted versions were created by scanning real objects with polycam and attaching them to XR interactable events. When users grab the objects to inspect them, the objects transform again into completely abstract objects created in openbrush. Custom audio generated in metasounds also plays when the objects are grabbed. Objects cannot be restored to their familiar forms and over time the viewer transforms their space into an unfamiliar one. The harder users try to understand their space the more distorted it becomes.</p>
