          <p><em>Be Studios focuses on being. Being grateful and tending to ourselves. Existing, breathing, and being present.</em> Be Studios is me and this is the core principle that drives everything I create. I hope to use my art to address heavy topics in approachable and interactive ways. My focus is on advocating for sustainable creative methods and ecological efforts. I often use organic or recycled materials in tandem with digital technologies that leave no large environmental footprint. I am invested in the blend between digital and traditional media as it offers a juxtaposition between the digital world and the natural one.</p>

          <p>I graduated from the Illinois State University Wonsook Kim College of Fine Arts with my Bachelor of Arts degree majoring in Graphic Design. I have also received an Associate degree in Graphic Communications. My undergraduate work focused heavily on print design, 2D animation, video production, and HTML/CSS. I am currently a Marketing Assistant at a nonprofit community college and have garnered a strong interest in advertising and branding. Businesses and profit margins are a root cause of global warming, pollution, deforestation, and the climate crisis. Therefore, I am interested in utilizing my marketing knowledge to create dynamic advertising for ecological efforts and to offer sustainable branding solutions to clients. I am also an Adjunct Professor at said college, and I have taught both Computer Imaging and Design and Introduction to Digital Media. Seeing education promote creativity and stimulate visual communication sparked a passion for generating interactive experiences through design. By coding interactive media and developing interactive packaging, I can draw awareness to environmental issues and make voting citizens face their impact on the environment in a comprehensive way.</p>

          <p>Another key topic in my work is self-expression and exploration. I spent my childhood in a religious cult and as an adult, I was diagnosed with OCD. These factors greatly shape my identity and impact my mental health. My own mind attempts to put me in a box and stifle my emotions and creativity. In contrast, art and nature are both fiercely independent and free of rigid rules. They are a form of therapy.</p>

          <p>My creative process is very fluid as my mediums vary greatly. Some of the software I use include Resolume Wire/Avenue, Unity, Metasounds within Unreal Engine, Procreate, Camera RAW, Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, Premiere, AfterEffects, and XD. I have also recently begun experimenting with Max/MSP/Jitter. Some of my projects have included creating typography with real objects, incorporating animation with painting, coding dynamic video effects to distort analog creations, coding dynamic visuals to iterate data that can be extracted for analog work, mapping found objects and textures into XR, designing interactive packaging, and creating mixed media sculpture.
I would like to continue exploring live, interactive art as well as focusing on the user experience. I hope to take a class in UI/UX design and want to learn JavaScript. I want to play with TouchDesigner and learn how to use EYESY so that I can pair it with natural sounds rather than music. I also want to continue creating mixed media projects that collage textiles with traditional “fine art” mediums and natural objects.</p>
