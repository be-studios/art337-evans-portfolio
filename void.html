        <div class="type">
<p>This is a wearable vest and necklace combination that represents the void that hunger creates in the stomach. The piece was created to remind viewers of the worldwide hunger crisis. The vest was patterned and cut from a metallic fabric and sewn by both hand and machine. The skeletal structure was created by cutting dowels with a saw and staining them. They were then connected to the vest with thread. The rib bones were created by crocheting over rope for added strength and texture. The bones were then sewn together and attached to the dowels by knotting the excess yarn. Finally, the sternum necklace was designed in Adobe Illustrator and both laser cut and engraved on a piece of scrap wood. The necklace hangs down on a knotted rope.</p>
