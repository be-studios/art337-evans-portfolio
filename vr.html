          <p><em> Exploring texture through virtual reality.</em></p>
<p>Users climb a tree and interact with textures in a virtual space. Grabbable VR objects account for the sound, texture, and weight differences of subtly different types of paper. I accomplished this by scanning 8 different types of paper into the computer at 600 dpi. I then used these scans to create custom albedos and normal maps that I applied to primitives in Unity. I also recorded audio from real-world interactions with each sheet and programmed the audio to playback when the virtual sheets are grabbed. I placed a tree asset in the middle of the space and arranged my primitives as “leaves” on the tree. The lighter-weight paper is positioned higher up on the tree to mimic the concept of “feeling lighter” and floating upwards. As the user teleports up the tree and interacts with each “leaf,” the paper will have less mass and more drag so that the sheet falls slower. The haptics will also become less intense as the altitude increases. I also added a skybox and created custom terrain with grass that responds to wind. Finally, I dropped in some background audio that plays on awake in order to add depth to the space.</p>
