        <p> This project was an exploration of celebrating identity. I learned that every culture has a unique way that their heritage shines through, especially during special occasions. The coffee cup from Professor Eman was a symbol of hospitality. Families and strangers gather around a tray of coffee and cups during holidays and as signifiers of peace and unity. The Sari from Professor Archana is an important representation of her religion. The draped aspect is symbolic of being untethered from material goods while the gold threading is sacred. This is worn during special occasions where identity and religion is celebrated. Finally, the pinback button celebrates a culmination of German heritage and American culture. The unity between the two shines through as both sides of a personâ€™s identity is celebrated on German Day. </p>
