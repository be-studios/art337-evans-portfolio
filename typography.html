        <p> This project was an exploration of celebrating identity. I photographed three objects of significance from three different cultures and built out shapes from the details of each photograph. These shapes became the building blocks of the typeface. The first object photographed was a coffee cup or ahweh. This object is a symbol of hospitality in Palestine where families and strangers gather around a tray of coffee during holidays as a signifier of peace and unity. The second object photographed was a Sari. This object is an important symbol of religion in India. The draping represents being untethered from material goods while the color of the gold in the threading is sacred. Sariâ€™s are worn during special occasions where identity and religion are celebrated. The last object photographed was a pinback button from a 1913 German Day Celebration in America. This was a celebration of the blending of German heritage and American culture. </p>
