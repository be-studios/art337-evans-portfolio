        <p> This project was an exploration of celebrating identity. I photographed three objects of significance from three different cultures. I drew out shapes from the details of each photograph. These shapes became the building blocks of the typeface. First, a coffee cup or ahweh. This object is a symbol of hospitality in Palestine. Families and strangers gather around a tray of coffee and cups during holidays as signifiers of peace and unity. Second, a Sari from India. This object is an important representation of religion. The draping is symbolic of being untethered from material goods and the gold threading is sacred. Sariâ€™s are worn during special occasions where identity and religion are celebrated. Third, a pinback button from a 1913 German Day Celebration in America. This is a celebration of the blending of German heritage and American culture. </p>
