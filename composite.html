        <p>This painting is an exploration of piecing components from several preexisting paintings with a shared theme of women's suffering. The idea was to create a tension between variety and unity through the use of different thicknesses, translucency, and rendering styles. Parts of the three paintings have a balanced division across the surface of one canvas, which creates a sense of chaos and harmony simultaneously. The paintings used as reference are Proserpine by Dante Rossetti, The Weeping Woman by Pablo Picasso, and The Girl at the Gate by Sir George Clausen.</p>
