        <p>This animated video was created alongside a poster on understanding cultural identity and heritage through cuisine. The 36 by 48 inch poster will be on display at Milner Library between April 4th and 29th. For the video portion of the piece, I recorded my husband as he created a dish specific to my ancestral heritage. I then overlayed animations onto the process video as well as incorporated my grandmother's voice as she talks about our family history. </p>

        During the design process, I chose to focus on the German part of my ancestry because it is most dominant. I have German ancestors on both sides of my family that are directly traceable. My family comes from Stahlhausen, Germany. They immigrated to Iowa in 1900 to buy farmland because agriculture was diminishing in Germany at the time. My great-grandfather, Heinrich Gnade, immigrated with his wife and three children. One of those children was my great grandma Amolia Gnade, the owner of the Graupensuppe recipe. She was an infant when they took the ship to America. Her mother was gravely ill during the trip, so Amolia had to be nursed by a volunteer onboard. Amolia had eight children and worked on the farm her entire life. She loved to cook large meals and have guests over almost every day.

        For the cuisine focus of the poster, I chose Graupensuppe because it is a family recipe from Germany. My grandma Beth shared her physical recipe card with me and traced the origin of the recipe back to her grandma Amolia’s mother. This barley soup is a comfort food as well as very hearty. It takes very few ingredients to make, and it really speaks to the resilient nature of my family. This piece also incorporates the historical origins of each of the ingredients used.

        I wanted the poster and video to portray the warmth of family gathering around a pot of soup after a long day. I illustrated the soup for the background and used the handwriting on my grandma’s physical recipe card for texture. The headline type is inspired by Jugendstil, which is a German design movement from the time of my ancestor’s immigration (between 1896 and 1914). Jugendstil consists of elongated, organic aspects inspired from Art Nouveau coupled with more geometric forms. I found a typeface in one of the Jugendstil posters and used this as inspiration to draw my own letterforms. I also brought the organic curvature of Jugendstil into the composition of my poster. These textural curves mimic the motion of stirring the soup. My process for creating these curves was to watch the stirring motion while cooking the dish and then sketch out those paths. The colors of the poster are pulled from the dish itself and then saturated more to match the yellow and red colors of Germany’s flag. I also chose to use a reddish grey text rather than black so that the page would have some softness. Finally, the icons were color graded in yellow and coupled with a red dotted line so that they would stand out. I added red to emphasize some key words and phrases to increase hierarchy. I also added a bit of white on the edges of the headline lettering and weaved the lines of body text underneath some of these letters for added depth.
