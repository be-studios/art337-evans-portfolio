            Design Streak Studio collaborated to rebrand the city of Atlanta Illinois. The work featuring the traditional look is featured here. The typography for the logo was hand drawn and then vectorized in Adobe Illustrator.

            This logo is a blend of tradition and timelessness. The character of the hand drawn letterforms emphasizes the historical aspects of the city while the overall sleekness of the silhouette represents progress. Inspiration for this concept focused on the traditional Americana style, which was essential to the culture of cities along route 66, such as Atlanta. The "A" in Atlanta is prominent, as it gives movement to the logo and guides the eye with its dynamic curves. This movement reflects the way that route 66 leads visitors through the city, showcasing each aspect of the city and all that it has to offer.  Additionally, the logo was created to work with and without the building icons, used to emphasize the building of community and unity with Atlanta's historic landmarks. The logo is paired with the typeface Cronos Pro. It embodies the warmth and readability of Old Roman Typefaces and has been used in books, older manuscripts, greeting cards and captions. The versatility and warmth symbolize the welcoming atmosphere of the city of Atlanta, IL. Its handwritten appearance gives it an elegant and distinguished feel and pairs comfortably with the hand drawn letterforms of Atlanta.The color blue was chosen for the main text, for its calm and inviting personality. Additionally generating a cool and modern tone, highlighting the progressive nature of Atlanta. The secondary color, a maroon red, was chosen to bring in some vintage warmth. This color depicts the qualities of Atlanta's citizens, such as being welcoming, passionate, and affectionate towards the city. This logo seeks to communicate the feelings shared by visitors of Atlanta and to showcase all that it has to offer.

            Additionally, each designer in the studio paired both proposed logos and branding with a specific deliverable for the client. The PDF below contains designs for the city's markers which are tailored to each look. </p>

            These marker signs are striking and engaging. The bold colors and playful shapes hold visual interest and spark curiosity so that viewers will read closer. Additionally, color brings emphasis to important highlights in the text. The dynamic lines tracing around the photographs brings them to life and the swooping curves are reminiscent of the fluidity of a road. This style is inspired by the work of American graphic designer Paul Rand, who created during the heyday of route 66 and is a fresh take on vintage Americana.
